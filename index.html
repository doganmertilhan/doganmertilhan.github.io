<p>Computer Engineering Student | Artificial Intelligence & Software Development</p>

<div class="section">
<h2>About Me</h2>
<p>
I am a third-year Computer Engineering student at Izmir University of Economics 
(GPA: 2.74/ 4.00) and pursuing a minor in Business Administration (Minor GPA: 
3.12/ 4.00). My studies focus on data structures, algorithms, and software 
development, with a strong interest in artificial intelligence and software systems 
for safety-critical and defense applications.
Through coursework and personal projects, I continuously develop my analytical 
and technical skills. My experience as a dormitory representative strengthened my 
responsibility, communication, and problem-solving abilities, enabling me to work 
effectively in diverse teams.
I am seeking an internship where I can contribute to real-world engineering 
projects and gain practical experience in a disciplined and collaborative 
environment.
